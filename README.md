# Heavy_Equipment_Co2_emission

Climate change became one of the most important issues facing the global community. Transportation is considered one of the major factors affecting on climate change specially road sector. This can be caused by emissions of roads’ construction, use and maintenance. These emissions can be assessed by using environmental Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches. The fundamental objective of this code is to assess the CO2 emissions of earthwork's equipment during roads construction per work hour.

CO2 emission of heavy equipment can be calculated from Equation 1:

C.E (Kg.hr) = F.C(gallon) * W (hr) * Mobile combustion Co2 factors(Kg/gallon)     Equation1

C.E = CO2 emission
F.C = Total fuel consumption
W = Machine working hours
Mobile combustion Co2 factors ===> for Diesel Fuel = 10.21 kg/gallon


The F.C can be calculated from Equation 2:

F.C(Kg) = W(hr.) * PI (kw) * LF * B.F (Kg/kw.hr)    Equation2

In this code using user's data, CO2 emission of each model of heavy equipment consisted of Bulldozers, Loaders, Skid Steers, Excavators, Motor Graders, Scrapers and, Road Rollers can be calculated.

***NOTE***
USERS HAVE TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MODEL AND MACHINE'S POWER INTERVAL AND JOB SITE'S CIRCUMESTANCE
